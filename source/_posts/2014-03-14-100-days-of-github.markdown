So I've decided to I need to get back to programming more things in my spare time. One way to kinda force this on myself is to attempt to do 100 days of github contributions. 

My first aim is to write an actual project to do something I need. Currently one of the things I need is something to give me better overview of the status of builds on Jenkins. Currently I just know if the builds are passing or failing. What I want is to know what branches are passing and failing. More importantly to keep a track of the develop and master branches. So I'm going to build something to make that task easier on myself.

A commit a day. How hard can it be?
